# knowtime

Introduction
===========
This is a simple, unobstrusive tool that helps you to realise how you are spending your time. Objective is to help you in increasing your focus and productivity.

knowTime allows you to define a heirarchy of tasks with notes.

In the Tasks pane, you can define some tasks by using the + button. Then you can add further sub-tasks by right clicking on any task and using the context menu. You may add notes for each task as well in the right side notes pane.

Once this is done, you can right click on any task and select Start Timing from the context menu.

Once the application is minimised, it reduces to a notiication icon on your system tray.

One can change one's Status of the current task, using the context menu on the notification icon. The context menu is generated dynamically based on the tasks that were added.

In the next tab, a time log displays the tasks and duration for each, in a list view.

knowTime is free to use - any feedback is greatly appreciated. There are plenty of time tracking applications already on the net, but creating something new always has scope for fresh ideas and better usability. Though some of the features are quite unique and there is probably good scope for commercialisation, this tool will always remain free as its the author's way of Paying-It-Forward! :)
Installation

knowTime is a single, standalone EXE, there is no set up involved, just download and run it!
